Right now, this is just a concept!

QuickAppJS will be a Full Stack, Rapid Application Development Framework for Node.js, which will automatically take care of all CRUD operations, backend, database and frontend GUI. It is inspired by [AllcountJS (which has sadly been discontinued)](https://allcountjs.com/) and [KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com/). Right now it is just a concept and development hasn't even begun, but when it is finished, it will turn a simple, easy to write JavaScript file into a running complex WebApp.

Just take a look at the examples folder.
